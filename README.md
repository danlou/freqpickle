# freqpickle

This is simply an extraction of word frequencies from the [wordfreq](https://github.com/LuminosoInsight/wordfreq) package.

## Why?

The wordfreq package is a great resource for NLP, but it's only compatible with Python 3 and you might find that it's unnecessary to use and additional package in your project if you just want to get word frequencies.

Here you can find a pickle file with the full english word frequencies and a script to generate your own from other languages supported by wordfreq (runs in Python 3 and you need to install wordfreq).
